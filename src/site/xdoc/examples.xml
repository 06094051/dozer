        There are some sample mapping files under {dozer.home}/src/main/mappings.  These mapping files are used by the Dozer unit tests.

        Another good area to look is {dozer.home}/samples. This has a classic example of mapping external facing services as well as external service dependencies.
        The dozerBeanMapping.xml file under samples shows just how easy it is to map a lot of data intensive objects. Most of the mappings are implicit so do not need to 
        be in the file.
